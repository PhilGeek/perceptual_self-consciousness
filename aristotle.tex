We perceive that we see and hear. Aristotle does not establish this so much as he presupposes it. In so doing he poses a how possible question. Given that we see and hear, how is it possible that we do? How possible questions are not posed out of the blue. If they are apt, then what occasions the question is a doubt about that very possibility. What occasions Aristotle's how possible question is the aporetic doubt about reflexive intentional powers developed in the \emph{Charmides}. Or so shall I argue.
