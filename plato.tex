\label{sec:introduction}



Our concern is with perceptual self-consciousness. But in order to frame the Socratic puzzles about perceptual self-consciousness, we shall begin by briefly discussing Critias' proposed definition of \emph{sōsphrosynē} as a kind of self-knowledge and its background since this will structure the hypothetical reflexive perceptual powers. 

The puzzles about the reflexive being of psychic powers such as \emph{sōsphrosynē}, self-knowledge, and perceptual self-consciousness, are themselves puzzling. For the \emph{aporiai} are reached on the back of claims to which Socrates, a participant of the dialogue, has elicited assent from Critias, but these are also claims that Socrates, the narrator of the dialogue, explicitly denies. The claims of the Socratic \emph{elenchus} leading to \emph{aporiai} in the argumentative portions of the dialogue must then be assessed against the claims of the dramatic portions of the text. The \emph{logos} must somehow be harmonized with the \emph{ergon}. As \citet{Schmid:1998aa} observes, the dialogue whose central puzzles concern reflexive modes of being is itself a text that ``relates itself to itself''. What might Plato signal thereby?

Addressing this requires that we distinguish three different perspectives in the dialogue:

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item \emph{Perspective 1}: The first is the perspective of Plato, the author of the dialogue, and his contemporary audience.
	\item \emph{Perspective 2}: The second is the perspective of Socrates, not the participant of the dialogue but its narrator, and his unnamed audience.
	\item \emph{Perspective 3}: The final perspectives are the perspectives of the participants of the dialogue, principally Socrates, Chaerephon, Charmides, and Critias.
\end{enumerate}

We need to attend to the perspective of Plato and his contemporary readership. For the common historical experience of the recent past will, at the various least, make certain aspects of the text salient in a way those aspects may not be to a reader, like ourselves, with a very different experience. Specifically, Critias and Charmides are relatives of Plato and participants in the reign of the Thirty Tyrants but did not survive it. Those who lived through that political disaster will naturally attend to certain aspects of the dialogue.

We need to attend to the perspective of Socrates' narration and its reception by his unnamed audience. Importantly, Socrates in narrating the dialogue either contradicts or says something in tension with what Socrates, the participant of the dialogue, claims. Specifically, Socrates in narrating the dialogue makes claims about perception that contradict the claims about perception made by the narrated Socrates in the course of his criticism of Critias. As we have seen, this combines with the first perspective. It is Plato who writes Socrates in narrating the dialogue make claims inconsistent with the claims the narrated Socrates makes. Whether or not this deliberate, understanding why this is so bears on the meaning of the text. 

We need to attend to the perspectives of the participants of the dialogue. The narrated events that precede Socrates' conversation with Charmides and then Critias are relevant to and so perhaps contains lessons about the main topic of the dialogue, \emph{sōphrosunē}. This too combines with the first perspective. For contrast the later tyrannical careers of Critias and Charmides and Critias and Charmides as they appear in the dialogue. How do the participants differ from their later selves? Perhaps more interestingly, can we observe the germs of their future tyranny? How would they have to be different to avoid there deaths defending tyranny?

The perspective of Plato and his contemporary readership raises a complication that I shall raise without resolving, since it is mostly irrelevant to my specific concerns. The dating of the dialogue matters. Most commentators hold that the dialogue was written after the reign of the Thirty Tyrants. But at least one commentator, \citet[108–9]{Schleiermarcher:1836aa} no less, maintains that the dialogue was written during their reign. \emph{Sōsphrosynē} is both an individual virtue as well as a civic virtue. So just as an individual may be \emph{sophron} so too may be the governance of a \emph{polis}. Even given our incomplete and imperfect understanding of the untranslatable virtue, given all accounts, we may be confident that the reign of the Thirty Tyrants was not \emph{sophron} (for example, Socrates was pressured by the Thirty to level a false accusation against a citizen whose property they sought to seize). Potential criticism of the Thirty might take different forms if during their reign or afterwards \citep[42]{Hyland:1981aa}, and this might lead the reader to differently interpret the text.

\section{The Third Offering} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_third_offering}

Puzzles about reflexive psychic powers arise in the context of assessing Critias' proposal that \emph{sōphrosunē} is a kind of self-knowledge. Specifically, \emph{sōphrosunē} is a kind of knowledge (\emph{epistēmē}). But it is unlike the knowledge involved in \emph{technai} such as medicine or architecture. Such knowledge is of a subject matter () that is distinct from it. So a physician who possesses the art of medicine has knowledge of a certain subject matter, health, and the physician's knowledge is distinct from its subject matter. Knowledge may be knowledge of something, but Critias maintains that \emph{sōphrosunē} is knowledge of itself and other knowledges and their lack. This is the proposal that Socrates agrees to investigate. That investigation has two parts:

\begin{quotation}
	Then only the \emph{sophron} person will know himself, and will be able to discern what he really knows and does not know, and have the power of judging what other people likewise know and think they know, in the cases where they do know, and again, what they think they know without knowing it; everyone else will be unable And so this is being \emph{sophron}, or \emph{sōphrosunē}, and knowing oneself⸺that one should know what one knows and does not know. Is that what you mean?
	
	It is, he replied.
	
	Once more then, I said, as our third offering to the Saviour, let us consider afresh, in the first place, whether such a thing as this is possible or not——to know that one knows, and does not know, what one knows and what one does not know; and secondly, if this is perfectly possible, what benefit we get by knowing it. (\emph{Charmides} 167a–b; \citealt[57]{Lamb:1927qw})
\end{quotation}

When Critias, in his long speech (164d4–165c4), first proposes that \emph{sōphrosunē} is a kind of self-knowledge, Socrates first emphasizes, as we would put it, the intentional character of knowledge: If \emph{sōphrosunē} is knowing (\emph{gignõskein}), it must be knowlege (\emph{epistēmē}) of something. If \emph{sōphrosunē} is knowledge of something, it is natural to ask what is it knowledge of? The third offering is meant to be Critias' full answer to this question, albeit subject to Socratic refinement.

According to the third offering \emph{sōphrosunē} is knowledge (\emph{epistēmē}) of:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item itself (\emph{autē heautēs} 166c3),
	\item other knowledges,
	\item their absence (\emph{anepistēmosunēs} 167c2, 166e7–8),
	\item and no other thing (\emph{monē} 166c2)
\end{enumerate}

Allow me to briefly comment on each of these aspects of the content of \emph{sōphrosunē}.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item When Socrates points out that, on previous account, one could be and act \emph{sophron} without knowing that one is \emph{sophron} (164c5–6), Critias pivots and identifies \emph{sōphrosunē} with self-knowledge (164d4–165c4). While, it is perhaps uncontroversial that \emph{sōphrosunē} should involve self-knowledge, at least as an element, Critias is making the grander claim that this very thing, self-knowledge, just is \emph{sōphrosunē} (164d3–4). No doubt hoping to secure Socrates assent in offering his intellectualist account of \emph{sōphrosunē} (\citealt[23–4]{Tuckey:1951aa}, \citealt[81]{Hyland:1981aa}, \citealt[161–2]{Tsouna:2022aa}), Critias' invokes and interprets the Delphic inscription ``Know Thyself'' (\emph{Gnōthi sauton}) in developing his new account. As Critias develops this account under Socratic questioning, \emph{sōphrosunē} is claimed to be knowing oneself (\emph{gignōskein heauton} 165b4), knowledge of oneself (\emph{epistēmē heatou} 165e1), and finally knowledge of itself (\emph{epistēmē autē heautēs} 166c3). Bracketing the slide from \emph{gnosis} to \emph{epistēmē}, one might reasonably query the move from knowing oneself to knowledge of itself. To be sure, in knowing oneself, what is known is not separate from the subject of such knowing, but that does not entail that what is known is the knowledge itself. Conversely, in possessing a knowledge which is knowledge of itself, does one really know oneself? Later Critias will answer this question in the affirmative (169d9–e5): when one possesses knowledge of itself one will know oneself. So the content of the knowledge that constitutes \emph{sōphrosunē} is, in modern parlance, reflexive: Such knowledge takes as its object that very knowledge, at least in part.
	\item Such knowledge is not only of itself, but it is of other knowledges.
	\item 
	\item 
\end{enumerate}




The knowledge of other knowledges, and their lack, has first- and third-personal aspects. The \emph{sophron} knows what they know and do not know. That is the first-personal aspect. But they also know what others know and do not know. This is the third-personal aspect.

\section{The Disanalogies} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_disanalogies}

\begin{quotation}
	Come then, I said, Critias, consider if you can show yourself any more resourceful than I am; for I am puzzled [\sbl{ἀπορῶ}]. Shall I explain to you in what way?
	
	By all means, he replied.
	
	Well, I said, what all this comes to, if your last statement was correct, it is merely that there is one knowledge which is precisely a knowledge of itself and the other knowledges, and moreover is a knowledge of the lack of knowledge [\sbl{ἀνεπιστημοσύνμς}] at the same time.
	
	Certainly.
	
	Then mark what a strange [\sbl{ἄτοπον}] statement it is that we are attempting to make, my friend: for if you will consider it as applied to other cases, you will surely see——so I believe——its impossibility [\sbl{ἀδύνατον}]. (\emph{Charmides} 167b—c; \citealt[57]{Lamb:1927qw}, modified)
\end{quotation}

Socrates is puzzled and explains that this is due to the strangeness (\emph{atopon}) of  Critias' account. His account is strange because it is unlike other more familiar cases. In these cases, the application Critias' account to them results in a manifest impossibility (\emph{adūnaton}). Socrates' puzzlement, here, does not so much as cast doubt on Critias' account, in the sense of providing a positive reason, however provisional, for rejecting that account, as it is an invitation to further inquiry (here I am in agreement with \citealt{Politis:2008nv}). It is likely that Critias understands Socrates puzzlement in this way. For Critias has earlier charged Socrates with eristic refutation:
\begin{quote}
	There you are, Socrates, he said: you push your investigation up to the real question at issue—in what \emph{sōphrosynē} differs from all the other knowledges—but you then proceed to seek some resemblance between it and them; whereas there is no such thing. (166b–c; \citealt[53]{Lamb:1927qw}, modified.)
\end{quote}	
Were Socrates pressing the disanalogies as a reason to reject the account, Critias would have good grounds to revive this complaint in a way that he declines to do. So it is neither an enthymeme (Aristotle, \emph{Rhetoric} 1402b15) nor an epagogic argument as many commentators maintain (see, for example, \citealt[41]{Robinson:1941yb}), but rather provides a motive for further inquiry, the results of which are the conclusion of The Argument from Relatives.

The disanalogies fall into three groups There are perceptual, conative, and cognitive cases:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item \emph{Perceptual}: sight (\emph{opsis}), hearing (\emph{akounē}), and the other senses more generally (\emph{peri pasōn tōn aisthēseon}) (167c8–d10)
	\item \emph{Conative}: appetite (\emph{epithumia}), wish (\emph{boulēsis}), love (\emph{eros}), and fear (\emph{phobos}) (167e1–168a?)
	\item \emph{Cognitive}: opinion (\emph{doxan}) (168a?)
\end{enumerate}
All of these cases either are or involve psychic powers. Only living beings have perceptual, conative, and cognitive powers. And only living beings exercise such powers. So though Socrates never explicitly claims that these powers are powers of the soul, insofar as the soul is the principle of life, only beings with souls have such powers. Not only do such cases involve psychic powers but all such powers are intentional in the minimal sense that they take an object. In exercising these powers there is something that is seen, heard, or perceived more generally. There is something desired, wished, loved, or feared. There is something about which one has an opinion. Moreover, knowledge, generally, and the self-knowledge with which Critias identifies \emph{sōphrosunē}, specifically, are themselves intentional psychic powers.

The first case, sight, makes explicit the parallels with Critias' account:
\begin{quote}
	Ask yourself if you think there is a sort of vision which is not the vision of things that we see in the ordinary way, but a vision of itself and of the other sorts of visions, and of the lack of vision likewise; which, while being vision, sees no colour, but only of itself and the other sorts of vision. (167c–d; \citealt[59]{Lamb:1927qw})
\end{quote}
Like the self-knowledge with which Critias identifies \emph{sōphrosunē}, the hypothetical form of vision is reflexive (it is a vision of itself) and higher-order (it is a vision of the other sorts of visions and not only these but their lack as well). And presumably, like the self-knowledge with which Critias identifies \emph{sōphrosunē}, it has first- and third-personal aspects. The other sorts of visions envisioned may be enjoyed by the perceiver themself or by other perceivers. But the hypothetical form of vision has an additional element to which Critias has yet to accede. The other sorts of visions take as their objects the colors. But the vision of itself and the other sorts of visions does not take the colors as its object the way that the other sorts of visions do. So this vision is intransitive or nontransparent. The vision of itself may take the other sorts of visions as its objects but it does not, in turn, take the objects of these other sorts of vision as its own object. The vision of itself that takes the other sorts of vision as an object does not see through them to colorful scenes that they disclose.
