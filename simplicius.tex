\begin{quote}
	Besides, it is absurd that the same sense should know that it sees. For it must be reflecting back on itself after having seen the colour that it gets to know that it sees. But if it reflects on itself it also has an activity which is separate, and what has a sperate activity has a separate substance, and on that account is eternal and incorporeal. So someone who says in an ambiguous way tha the rational soul is immortal will be shouting out plainly that the non-rational soul is immortal; which is absurd. The senses are not eternal, and for that reason do not reflect on themselves. And if they do not reflect on themselves they do not lay hold of their own activities. For a thing's reflecting on itself is nothing other than the laying hold of itself. (Philoponus)
